	<p>Through out my year I have always enjoyed english class mostly because of my teacher and was always exited to go to class. Coding was a nice way to ease into the morning and was a low stress environment for most of the year. Spanish was my first class it was too early in the morning to be aclimated to the enviroment so I would zone out a lot. Histroy was an easy class because I love to learn about history so I already knew a lot of the content and like to learn knew things in the class. Public speaking was a nerve racking class because I have horrible stage fright and even through I messed up a good amount of times I still feel like I'm a better speaker than I was. In math class we learned things but most of the time it was independant work so I would just talk with my friends while we were doing the work. Chemistry has been tough and is the class I'm have been the most worried about this year.</p>
