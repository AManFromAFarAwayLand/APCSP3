	<p>Video games have been my main way to relax this year. I find it to be a fun activitty to do with friends or by yourself depending on the game. Throught this years I have played all kinds of games form all kinds of different genres and they've helped me feel better if I've had a hard day.</p>

	<p>I ran both cross country and track this year and there have been a lot of benifts to doing them. One is the fact I have become more fit then I was before I started. It also helps me conect with people and make friendships. I plan on doing cross country and track for the rest of my high school career even though I'm trebbile at it because of the enjoyment I get with hanging out with others.</p>

           <p>Over this year I voluntiered a lot and only a 1/3 of it was for school. I join with a voluntering organization which gave us a list of places to voluntier at and we had to get 10 hours. I ended up getting 20 hours mostly because my brother had to do 15 hours for his so I decided I would just go for 20 because of how close I was and I ended up reaching that goal. I also did 10 hours of voluntiering for school and only recently found out I could have used my hours from the organization as my school hours. Voluntiering has been a fun activty that leaves me feeling better than I started and I recomend everybody does it.</p>
